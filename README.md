This is the application that the test cases are to be written for. The following application was provided by the university and was not developed by me.
The application is purposely buggy and written not following the best coding practices, so that the student has an opportunity to develop a test cases, forming a professional bug report, as well as to report the bugs by applying Black Box and White Box testing techniques.
